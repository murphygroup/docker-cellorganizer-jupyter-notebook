## About CellOrganizer

![CellOrganizer Logo](http://www.cellorganizer.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CellOrganizerLogo2-250.jpg)

The [CellOrganizer](http://cellorganizer.org/) project provides tools for

* learning generative models of cell organization directly from images
* storing and retrieving those models
* synthesizing cell images (or other representations) from one or more models

Model learning captures variation among cells in a collection of images. Images used for model learning and instances synthesized from models can be two- or three-dimensional static images or movies.

[CellOrganizer](http://cellorganizer.org/) can learn models of

* cell shape
* nuclear shape
* chromatin texture
* vesicular organelle size, shape and position
* microtubule distribution.

These models can be conditional upon each other. For example, for a given synthesized cell instance, organelle position is dependent upon the cell and nuclear shape of that instance.

Cell types for which generative models for at least some organelles have been built include human HeLa cells, mouse NIH 3T3 cells, and Arabidopsis protoplasts. Planned projects include mouse T lymphocytes and rat PC12 cells.

### CellOrganizer v2.8.2
#### Fixes
* Fixed issue where OMETIFF with no ROI was considered an empty image.
* Included support for Virtual Cell. Geometries can now be exported as VCML.

#### Other
* Added demo3D60 that exports an instance as VCML.

### CellOrganizer v2.8.1

#### Fixes
* Display shape space when dataset field is not present or empty.
* Generation of watertight SBML Spatial output has been corrected for translation errors.

#### Other
* The following models have been rebuilt using this version of CellOrganizer. Updated models can be found in the model repository.

  - 2D HeLa diffeomorphic framework
  - 2D HeLa PCA framework
  - 2D HeLa classic framework

* CellOrganizer for Galaxy now supports Galaxy server v19.05.

#### Demo List

The following demo scripts are included and have been tested in the image.

| demo3D12 |            X           |           |

The demos in the table above are the same demos included in the Matlab distribution.

### CellOrganizer v2.8.0

#### Features
* Added improved model for generating protein distributions during T cell synapse formation that only requires annotation of cell couples at a single time point model and improves synapse alignment. Includes training, synthesis and info demos.
* Added outline PCA model for 2D cell and nuclear shapes. Includes training, synthesis and info demos.
* Added SPHARM-RPDM model for 3D cell and nuclear shapes (see https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty983). Includes training, synthesis and info demos.

#### Fixes
* Fixed issues with options.train.flag. Valid options should be nuclear, cell, framework, and protein.

#### Enhancements
* Modularized and cleaned up img2slml.
